# Token Efficiency & Output Accuracy

## Output Format
- Specify exact output structure (code only, bullet list, JSON, single paragraph)
- State length constraints explicitly ("respond in under 50 words", "3 bullet points max")
- Request structured formats (numbered lists, tables) when comparing or enumerating

## Precision
- One task per prompt; chain complex tasks sequentially
- State success criteria upfront ("correct if X, Y, Z are true")
- Include constraints that eliminate ambiguity ("use ES6 syntax", "no external dependencies")
- Provide negative constraints ("do not include explanations", "omit imports")

## Context Efficiency
- Reference existing context by location rather than restating it
- Omit background the model already has access to
- Front-load critical information; place constraints before content

## Avoid
- Temporal references ("latest", "current", "recent")
- Redundant rephrasing of the same instruction
- Open-ended questions when specific answers are needed
- Vague qualifiers ("good", "better", "proper") without criteria
